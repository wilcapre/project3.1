In this project, we'll use JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form 
for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf."

Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, I'm going to add JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:
adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
